//! A multi-producer, single-consumer, futures-aware, FIFO queue with back pressure.
//!
//! A channel can be used as a communication primitive between tasks running on
//! `futures-rs` executors. Channel creation provides `Receiver` and `Sender`
//! handles. `Receiver` implements `Stream` and allows a task to read values
//! out of the channel. If there is no message to read from the channel, the
//! curernt task will be notified when a new value is sent. `Sender` implements
//! the `Sink` trait and allows a task to send messages into the channel. If
//! the channel is at capacity, then send will be rejected and the task will be
//! notified when additional capacity is available.
//!
//! # Disconnection
//!
//! When all `Sender` handles have been dropped, it is no longer possible to
//! send values into the channel. This is considered the termination event of
//! the stream. As such, `Sender::poll` will return `Ok(Ready(None))`.
//!
//! If the receiver handle is dropped, then messages can no longer be read out
//! of the channel. In this case, a `send` will result in an error.
//!
//! # Clean Shutdown
//!
//! If the `Receiver` is simply dropped, then it is possible for there to be
//! messages still in the channel that will not be processed. As such, it is
//! usually desirable to perform a "clean" shutdown. To do this, the receiver
//! will first call `close`, which will prevent any further messages to be sent
//! into the channel. Then, the receiver consumes the channel to completion, at
//! which point the receiver can be dropped.

// At the core, the channel uses an atomic FIFO queue for message passing. This
// queue is used as the primary coordination primitive. In order to enforce
// capacity limits and handle back pressure, a secondary FIFO queue is used to
// send parked task handles.
//
// The general idea is that the channel is created with a `buffer` size of `n`.
// The channel capacity is `n + num-senders`. Each sender gets one "guaranteed"
// slot to hold a message. This allows `Sender` to know for a fact that a send
// will succeed *before* starting to do the actual work of sending the value.
// Since most of this work is lock-free, once the work starts, it is impossible
// to safely revert.
//
// If the sender is unable to process a send operation, then the the curren
// task is parked and the handle is sent on the parked task queue.
//
// Note that the implementation guarantees that the channel capacity will never
// exceed the configured limit, however there is no *strict* guarantee that the
// receiver will wake up a parked task *immediately* when a slot becomes
// available. However, it will almost always unpark a task when a slot becomes
// available and it is *guaranteed* that a sender will be unparked when the
// message that caused the sender to become parked is read out of the channel.
//
// The steps for sending a message are roughly:
//
// 1) Increment the channel message count
// 2) If the channel is at capacity, push the task handle onto the wait queue
// 3) Push the message onto the message queue.
//
// The steps for receiving a message are roughly:
//
// 1) Pop a message from the message queue
// 2) Pop a task handle from the wait queue
// 3) decreemnt the channel message count.
//
// It's important for the order of operations on lock-free structures to happen
// in reverse order between the sender and receiver. This makes the message
// queue the primary coordination structure and establishes the necessary
// happens-before semantics required for the acquire / release semantics used
// by the queue structure.
